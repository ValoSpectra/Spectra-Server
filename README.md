# ValoSpectra - Server

Spectra is your all-in-one solution for an amazing looking Valorant Tournament Overlay, enabling all Organizers to display information like held gun, available credits etc. with just a single spectator running software.
To learn more and see a live demo, visit [valospectra.com](https://www.valospectra.com/).

It is comprised of three parts:
 - [The Spectra Client](https://github.com/ValoSpectra/Spectra-Client)
   - Running this software on a single in-game observer provides the Spectra Server with all data currently provided by Overwolf.
 - [The Spectra Server](https://github.com/ValoSpectra/Spectra-Server)
   - Ingests data from the Observer Client to reproduce the games state, allowing us to have an accurate representation of the game for further use.
 - [The Spectra Frontend](https://github.com/ValoSpectra/Spectra-Frontend)
   - Receives the game state from the Server every 100 milliseconds, presenting it in a beautiful manner for viewers to enjoy.

Further updates for new features, as well as a detailed setup guide and an easy to host docker container are in the pipeline!

# Docker Compose tutorial:
First, create a seperate folder in your working directory:
```
$ mkdir -p spectra-server/keys
$ cd spectra-server
```

Create a file named docker-compose.yml as follow:
```
---
services:
  valo-spectra-server:
    image: "ghcr.io/valospectra/server"
    ports:
      - "5100:5100"
      - "5101:5101"
      - "5200:5200"
    volumes:
      - ./keys:/app/keys
    environment:
      - INSECURE=true
```
Inside ```keys``` folder, add your SSL certificate and key. If your SSL is trusted, you can set ```INSECURE=false```. If you don't provide any, a self-signed one will be generated for you.

After that you can start the server by running: ```docker compose up -d```
